# PYTHON-PROJECTS-
Python projects that I made:

The Payment processing system is so far the one i'm most proud of, It contains most core features of a payment processing system. When you visit it for the first time, it creates the necessary files and updtaes creates a record for you in the general client file.

Client personal files are json files. Whenever a client makes a transaction on the system, it updates their json file with that info including time, amount, their new balance etc and does the same to the receiver of the money incase it was a send money transaction. 

Also, the user can query the system to receive an a transactional history which is something that happens quite often. They can choose to receive it via email which the system sends to  their provided user email well formatted and readable or via whatsapp or printed on the teminal.

I am proud to be learning technologies that will enable me to connect this system to an actual database (preferrably postgresql) and create a UI and give it to my friends to experiment with!!
